## What is Virtualization?

In basic terms, virtualization is the process of creating virtual objects or systems. As used today, it is commonly employed for creating virtual machines, such as the one we will be creating. However, it can also be used to allocate network resources, or for storage.

Virtualization is made possible by software called **hypervisors**. Hypervisors create and manage virtual machines at a system level. Hypervisors can either run on hardware (type 1) or run on an operating system (type 2). VirtualBox utilizes a type 2 hypervisor.

### Types of Virtualization

Virtualization can be divided into two types: client-side and server-side virtualization. 

In client-side virtualization, the virtualizing process takes place on the current computer locally. A computer must have the necessary hardware requirements in order to support client-side virtualization. This is the type of virtualization being used in this tutorial.

Server-side virtualization has another computer virtualize a system that can then be accessed over the network by another computer. Server-side virtualization allows a computer that is not capable of virtualizing to access and utilize virtual machines.
