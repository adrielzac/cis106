# Deliverable 1

## Introduction

Linux has been the go-to operating system for those who want an open environment that can be modified to their liking. Widely used amongst the tech industry with both corporations and individual enthusiasts alike, Linux has remained the choice OS across a variety of use case, such as backend server work or even for hacking. In this breakdown, we will go over Linux, its history, types of Linux distributions, and how to install a popular Linux distribution: Ubuntu.

## Requirements: Software and Hardware

Installing Ubuntu on your computer has different requirements depending on your method of installation.

If you choose to install Ubuntu directly on your system, you will require:

- A 2ghz processor with at least 2 cores
- 4GB of RAM
- At least 25gb of hard disk space (the minimal installation only requires 8.6)
- Computer display
- External flash or CD drive to utilize the installer media

###### (note that the minimal installation can be run on lesser specifications)

If you choose to install Ubuntu through a virtual machine (VirtualBox will be used here) you will require all the above requirements as well as the VirtualBox software installed.

## What is Linux?

Linux is a term to describe open source systems that are built on or based on the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel first released in 1991. Since then many variants of Linux have released, called distributions. Since Linux is infinitely customizable, many people and organizations have taken the Linux kernel and tailored it to their own distribution. Ubuntu - the distribution being installed in this tutorial - is one of many that are widely used. Other popular distributions include Fedora, Mageia, Mint, and Arch. While not as widely used in the hands of the average person like Windows or MacOS, Linux remains the choice OS for computing enthusiasts and businesses.


### A Short History of Linux  

The Linux kernel was made in 1991 by Linus Torvalds. Since then, it has gone under numerous events and variations before becoming distributions we use today. Here are some events that helped shape Linus below:

**1991** - In August, Linus Torvalds sends an email to a newsgroup that details his intentions to develop a free operating system as a hobby. Shortly after he develops the first Linux kernel
**1992** - Linux becomes open source under the General Public License
**1993** - Slackware, a popular Linux distribution that would later be the basis for many others, is released to the public
**1997** - The GNOME project is born. GNOME is a desktop environment that many Linux distributions use by default. It has given use many of the programs we use on Linux today.
**1998** - KDE 1.0 is released. This is another set of software that would later become integral in many Linux distributions 
**2002** - Red Hat Enterprise Linux is released. The Red Hat Linux distribution put Linux on the market as a business solution that is still used today
**2004** - Ubuntu 4.10 is released. This release marked a turning point for Linux. It was a distribution that allowed a normal user to easily install and utilize Linux
**2005** - Torvalds creates Git, an open source version control system
**2008** - Android 1.0 is released, marking Linux's first step into the mobile market

### Linux Distributions

In order to understand where Linux as we use it today comes from, we have to look at several distributions throughout the years

#### Slackware

Slackware is a Linux distribution that was created in 1993 by Patrick Volkerding. It is currently the oldest distribution of Linux that is still actively updated. Slackware was created emphasizing simplicity first. It attempts to keep software loaded as unmodified as possible to ensure the user gets a pure experience. Slackware is the basis for many other Linux distributions and was a key release in the history of Linux

#### Debian

Debian is another Linux distribution also created in 1993. It is the second oldest distribution of Linux that is actively maintained. Debian has multiple contributors across the internet. Debian is also the basis for 2 very important distributions that exist today: **Ubuntu** and **Kali Linux**. 

Ubuntu is a Linux distribution designed to be as friendly as possible to the average user, sporting an easy-to-use graphical interface, simplified commands, and is equipped with all the programs one may need to use it as a primary operating system. 

Kali Linux is a distribution intended to be used for security purposes. It is used for penetration testing and forensics. Kali Linux comes included with close to 600 penetration testing programs that a user can take advantage of to ensure the security of their software

#### Red Hat Enterprise Linux

Developed in 2002, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is a popular Linux distribution that is used commercially. RHEL is open-source like many other Linux distributions, however Red Hat has created restrictions and trademarks to ensure that RHEL cannot be freely redistributed. In order to use the operating system commercially, the license must be purchased. The development of RHEL is closely related to **Fedora Linux**. 

Fedora Linux is another Linux distribution that is used for general purposes and as a test bed for RHEL. RHEL releases are worked off Fedora Linux releases into their own fork and released as a separate operating system.

## Open Source vs Closed Source

One of the main points to the Linux name is its claim to being open source. Open source software is software which has source that is freely available, such that it may be changed and then redistributed. This is contrast to closed source software, which use some form of licensing to modify and share. 

There are many advantages to open source software, such as:

- Its almost always free to use. This means that its very cost effective and open source software can be used as alternatives to their licensed counterparts
- Open source projects have large contributions from the community that ensure they are kept up to date
- Open source software can be modified and scaled up easily to use in mass deployment
- The community can provide support to its users (can be a disadvantage)
  
Open source also has its disadvantages:

- Freely accessible source code means that vulnerabilities can be found easily
- Community support is generally not as accessible as support from a company that uses licenses


Closed source software similarly has its own advantages:

- Closed source software tends to be more user friendly
- Security in closed source software is more reliable
- Support is handled directly by the organization licensing the software
- 

With disadvantages as well:

- Generally not free
- Updates can be slower due to closed door development
- Licensing can be restrictive: certain amount of users or systems using a certain license

## The Free Software Movement

The free software movement is a movement created to ensure freedoms to software users. These freedoms are:

- the freedom to run a program
- the freedom to study a program
- the freedom to redistribute a program
- the freedom to modify and distribute your own version of the program
  
The open source community is built upon and operates on these principles.

### The General Public License

The General Public License (GPL) is a compilation of software licenses that guarantee users the above principles when using software under that license. The only redistribution requirement to the license is that any programs that are created off the basis of another program are required to be distributed under the GPL. Many integral programs that have contributed greatly to the open source movement have been licensed under the GPL.
