# Wildcards

Wildcards are characters that represent other ambiguous characters in a file name. The * wildcard character can be anything as well as any amount of characters. As an example, this can be used to find files that end with a certain file extension. 

The ? wildcard represents only a single character. This can be used to narrow down files that you want to search that have a specific amount of characters in the name or extension. 

The [] brackets wildcard represents a single character but in the range specified within the brackets. This is helpful for when you have a range of letters you want to narrow down in a specific location in the file name.


# Brace Expansion

Brace expansion is a feature that lets you use multiple strings within a single command. Using {} with the strings in between, you can remove, create, list, and copy multiple files or directories in one single command, simplifying the workflow of the command prompt.
