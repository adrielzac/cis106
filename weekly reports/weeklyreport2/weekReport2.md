# Week Report 2

## Summary of Presentations

In the week 2 lecture, we learned about virtualization. Virtualization is simulating a machine inside another machine. There are two types of virtualization: server-side and client-side. The virtualization we work with is client-side. Client-side virtualization is software installed on a computer to manage virtual machines on the client physical machine. Virtualizing requires a hypervisor, which is the software that manages the virtual machines. Type 1 hypervisors run on hardware and type 2 hypervisors run on the host OS.

# Raspberry Pi

A Raspberry Pi is a small computer that can plug into a display and uses regular peripherals. It can do everything a regular computer can do. Since they are so small, they do not have the same hardware capabilities as a full size machine. Current Pi models include:
    - Raspberry Pi 4
    - Raspberry Pi 3
    - Raspberry Pi Zero W
    - Raspberry Pi 3 A+
    - Raspberry Pi 400

The most current models of the Pi are the Pi 4 and the Pi 400, which is the same as the Pi 4 with a built in keyboard. The Pi 4 has 4 USB ports, type C power, a micro SD card slot, wifi and bluetooth, and a quad core processor.

There are many projects you can do with a Raspberry Pi including:
    - Make a network wide adblocker
    - Make a media server
    - Use it as an emulation machine
    - Use it as a game server
    - Run Android TV
